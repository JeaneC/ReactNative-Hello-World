# ReactNative - Projects
__Description:__ This repository contains a few projects I've been working on in ReactNative. The earlier projects built components from scratch, and the later projects did a mix of using open-sourced components or reusing/recreating other components. When I find the time, I'll give each project its own doc, but these are helpful for me mainly because I can reuse a lot of code, and I try to comment out functions of each piece of code.

1. __Albums__ - Created components like Buttons/Cards/Spinners from scratch
2. __Auth__ - Implemented Firebase login
3. __TechStack__ - Created ListViews with a Redux Mindset
4. __Manager__(discontinued) - Login + Profile Parsing From A Database
5. __Swipe__ - Animating A List of Cards similar to Tinder
6. __OneTimePassword__ - Cloud Functions with __Firebase__ and __Twilio__ for __FirebaseAuth__
7. __FirebaseAuth__ - Manually create a one-time auth token by texting the user. When the user enters the verification code back correctly, the user gets access to everything in firebase.
8. __Jobs__ - This uses a combination of everything before + MapViews. Using Indeed's API, this fetch's jobs nearby your location, and you can swipe cards in a deck containing the jobs you'd like to save or not.
9. __Mapstest__ - This is really just a playground that has all of the MapView's API by AirBNB imported into an expo project folder
10. __MapMaker__ - This is a tool to (1) plot map markers and get their coordinates, (2) plot polylines to route between two points, and (3) play around with any features!
