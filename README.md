# ReactNative - Projects
__Description:__ This repository contains a few projects I've been working on in ReactNative. The earlier projects built components from scratch, and the later projects did a mix of using open-sourced components or reusing/recreating other components. When I find the time, I'll give each project its own doc, but these are helpful for me mainly because I can reuse a lot of code, and I try to comment out functions of each piece of code.

1. Albums - Created components like Buttons/Cards/Spinners from scratch
2. Auth - Implemented Firebase login
3. TechStack - Created ListViews with a Redux Mindset
4. Manager(discontinued) - Login + Profile Parsing From A Database
5. Swipe - Animating A List of Cards similar to Tinder
6.
